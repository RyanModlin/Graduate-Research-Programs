# Graduate-Research-Programs

There are three seperate projects listed. The first project, (genome motif search), supports the codon optimization process by identifying underrepresented sequences in the genome.

The second project, (modeling Minion reads), contains two parts. The first part of the project models MinION reads to the probability mass function of the Possion Distribution based off time. This will allow the user to more accurately quantify unique samples in a nanopore run. The second part of the project focuses on classifying and identifying MinION reads based off of their voltage patters in a CNN. This project is focused on quantification of unique molecules in a run meaning that classifying a molecuele is more important the pulling exact sequence information and processing time can be reduced.

The last project supports my undergraduate research. Here, I created a synthetic computational model of the introduced Progesterone Pathway in Y. lipolytica via the gillespie algorithim.
